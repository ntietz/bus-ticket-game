# Bus Ticket Game

Premise: you are given a ticket when you board the bus, which has a six digit number on it.
Your goal is to find a way to use arithmetic (just addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to form 100, with each digit separate (no splitting "100111" into "100 * 1 * 1 * 1").
You are allowed to reorder the numbers.

Example: you get the ticket "657711". One solution is: (7 + 7 + 6) * 5 * 1 * 1 = 20 * 5 = 100

This repo contains utilities to check if puzzles are solvable. Eventually, I may add a webapp version of the game.
